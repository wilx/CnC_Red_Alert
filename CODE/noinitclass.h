/**********************************************************************
**	This class is solely used as a parameter to a constructor that does
**	absolutely no initialization to the object being constructed. By using
**	this method, it is possible to load and save data directly from a
**	class that has virtual functions. The construction process automatically
**	takes care of initializing the virtual function table pointer and the
**	rest of the constructor doesn't initialize any data members. After loading
**	into a class object, simply perform an in-place new operation.
